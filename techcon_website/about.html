            <h2>History</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Founding:2010</h3>
            <p>n 2010, a group of visionary technologists and entrepreneurs came together with a common goal: to create a space where innovators could exchange ideas and showcase cutting-edge technologies. 
                This led to the launch of TechCon, held in a modest venue with just 500 attendees. The first conference was centered around emerging fields like cloud computing, mobile applications,
                 and early developments in AI.</p>
